/**
 * Clonal describes the phylogenetic structure of subclones
 * 
 * The structure is described by a string in quasi-Newick format,
 * except here we don't really care about branch length, 
 * so only end nodes are specified, and the number associated with each node is the proportion of the sub-clone population
 * 
 * For example:
 * (A:0.5,B:0.5)
 * (A:0.5,(B:0.2,C:0.3))
 * And so on
 * 
 * The tree structure will also be used to implement mutations within different clades
 *
